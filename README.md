üîß Scaffold-AVS is an open-source toolkit for building your own Eigenlayer AVS. This repository branch includes the [Multi-Prover AVS](https://github.com/automata-network/multi-prover-avs/) contracts and an how-to guide on how to recreate this. It's main goal is to be a learning tool for new AVS developers. By following this guide, developers can learn how to use [Scaffold-AVS](https://github.com/automata-network/multi-prover-avs) to setup their own AVS or migrate over an existing AVS. In the second part of the guide, developers can learn how to create a dashboard in just a few minutes by using the [Scaffold-ETH](https://scaffoldeth.io/) hooks that are part of this repository. 

‚öôÔ∏è Built using Eigenlayer, NextJS, RainbowKit, Foundry, Wagmi, Viem, and Typescript.

## Tutorials

To help new developers use the Scaffold-AVS repo, I have written two tutorials on how to use it.

#### Migrate your AVS contracts over to a Scaffold-AVS repo
This guide starts with the Scaffold-AVS repo with Hello World AVS. If then gives all the steps that are needed to migrate the Multi-Prover AVS over to the Scaffold-AVS repo.

#### Migrate your AVS contracts over to a Scaffold-AVS repo
This guide starts where the first article ended. It shows you how to setup a new AVS dashboard for the Multi-Prover AVS, using the Scaffold-AVS template. Even without any React, NextJS or frontend knowledge, developers can create handy dashboards in minutes.
